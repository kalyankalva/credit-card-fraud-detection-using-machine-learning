About the project - As the globe moves faster and faster toward online and card-based payment systems, the market for digital payments is exploding. Such a change brings with it the escalating problem of cybersecurity and fraud, which is more prevalent than ever. A recent study predicted that during the next five years, credit card theft will cost the world around $43 billion. According to different research, up to 80% of presently used US credit cards have had their security breached. All banks and financial institutions place a high premium on improving the detection of credit card fraud. Machine learning (ML) has made it simpler and more effective to detect credit card fraud. Solutions for fraud detection that uses machine learning can spot trends and stop unusual transactions.

This paper investigates the comparative performance of Random forest, xgboost, and Adaboost classifier models in the binary classification of imbalanced credit card fraud data. The rationale for investigating these three techniques is due to less comparison they have attracted in past literature. However, a subsequent study to compare other single and ensemble techniques using our approach is underway. Our main goal of this research is to define appropriate predictive machine learning models for the dataset to detect fraud in using a credit card.
